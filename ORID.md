### O
- SpringBoot Practice
- Pair Programming with TDD

### R
- I feel that I have a better understanding of the SpringBoot framework.


### I
- Pair programming with my team member, allowing me better understand the code and 
easier to follow the progress of the lesson. I was able to keep up with the lesson.
It is a good way to learn and practice coding.

  
### D
- I would practice more on SpringBoot to get a better understanding of the framework.
Since there are quite a lot annotations to remember.
